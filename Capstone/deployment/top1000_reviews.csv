B0BN72MLT2,United States,19-09-2024,True,1,1st purchase was great! This one was not!,"I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSNNT7MIGKJWN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN73VMBR,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024",Service Provider: AT&TColor: MidnightSize: 128GB,B0BN73VMBR,"1st purchase was great!

B09G9D8KRQ,India,30-07-2022,True,4,Review after 1 week of usage,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R16W6CTIKEUDKM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G99CW2N,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2022,Colour: (PRODUCT) REDSize: 128 GB,B09G99CW2N,"Review after 1 week of usage Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day.

Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white!

I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

B09G9D8KRQ,India,04-02-2023,True,4,Android to Apple Transition - Not a very smooth experience,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm.

Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm.

It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar.

Even if you go broke!,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase.

So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features! So, people inorder to prove that this is a very unique feature, unnecessarily use it, show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an Iphone.

B09G9BL5CP,India,18-07-2024,True,4,Iphone 13,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I’m genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here’s a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It’s clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it’s the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished.

But again that could just be my SIM card on it's way out. Something about certain aspects of the phone feel much cheaper than bits of it's predecessor. For example the rear glass. Yes it's supposedly the same ceramic shield from the 12 but I've found it scratches much easier for no real reason. Another example is the speaker grille in the front notch. It looks alot cheaper and sounds that way too than the one in the 12. Pretty tinny and just rattley sounding. It's not a horrible phone. It's the first iPhone I've felt like I can get android style utility from. But the questionable build quality changes over the previous generation just stifle it for no reason. That's not to say the phone is entirely built out of meh. For example the camera lenses and the bump are much bigger on the new 13. I work as a mechanic and subjected my old 12 to the same rigors. The 12 took it like a champ aside from very light camera lenses scratching. I've subjected the 13 to much more stress and it just shrugs it off aside from the seemingly unexplainable rear glass scratches. I haven't dropped it like my 12 yet so theres always that.

Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim).

Third Party App Size is Huge (Gmail is 300MB / YouTube 250 MB). No native app lock option4. Very Less OS customizations / No Fingerprint Scanner (hopeful this gets better with iOS 16)5.

B0CHX1W1XY,India,23-12-2023,True,3,First iphone and not up to the mark,"After using for two days, here's what I found out. First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away.

First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away.

I have to repeatedly turn it on and off, even full on smacking the screen for it to work. I wish I had bought a new Apple phone because this has been a waste of money. Also, it took me a good 2 hours with tech support from Verizon and Apple to get the eSIM to work. Amazon didn’t help at all. Again, PLEASE DON’T BUY THIS PHONE!! It’s not worth the headache to save a couple hundred bucks because anything you “saved” will be used to buy a new phone anyways.",181,"{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.9644}",0.042,0.815,0.144,0.9644,0,0,0,0,,,,,,0,,0.0,,,

A day after, I realized that the camera isn't working. I contacted Apple customer service. After running a diagnostic test they informed me that the camera in the device was changed and replaced with a non-genuine Apple camera. After reporting this to Amazon, I was told that it could take up to 30 business days for my money to be returned, after returning the device.

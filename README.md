    1. - Input data: iPhone reviews downloaded from Kaggle.
    2. - Data cleaning and preprocessing: To enhance prediction accuracy.
    3. - Sentiment analysis: To delve into the major issues reported in the reviews.
    4. - ASBA: To explore the possibility of replacing expensive and slow LLMs with smaller, custom models. These models should be simple, scalable, and maintain acceptable quality.
    5. Model deployment: We’ll use AWS SageMaker. We’ll monitor data drift and performance and retrain the model every six months once we have enough new reviews. We’ll share the deep insights with business development teams so they can take necessary actions to improve customer satisfaction.

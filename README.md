### Capstone project on iPhone reviews sentiment and aspect-based sentiment analysis
  - Refer Capstone/
  - Gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, preprocessing, prompt engineering, model training, deployment, and AWS SageMaker Studio, as well as MLOps and other related technologies


### Mini projects from the Machine Learning Engineering & AI Bootcamp offered by UMass Global
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Logistic Regression
  - Trees and Forests
  - Build a Machine Learning Model
  - Deep Learning with Keras
  - Transfer Learning with Keras
  - Recommendation Engines
  - Flask for ML Tasks
  - Churn prediction using AWS SageMaker

### Additional notes on capstone project:
    1. - Input data: iPhone reviews downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmars1010/iphone-customer-reviews-nlp)
    2. - Data cleaning and preprocessing: To enhance prediction accuracy.
    3. - Sentiment analysis: To delve into the major issues reported in the reviews.
    4. - ASBA: To explore the possibility of replacing expensive and slow LLMs with smaller, custom models. These models should be simple, scalable, and maintain acceptable quality.
    5. - Model deployment: We’ll use AWS SageMaker. We’ll monitor data drift and performance and retrain the model every six months once we have enough new reviews or due to performance goes low. We’ll share the deep insights with business development teams so they can take necessary actions to improve customer satisfaction.
